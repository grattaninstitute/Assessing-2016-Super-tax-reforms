contributors to structural deficits.

households over the age of 65 increased in real terms from $23,000
to $32,000 per household over the age of 65.7 The increase in net
transfers to older households has worsened Australian government
budgets by $22 billion a year.8

For more than a decade, superannuation tax breaks have been ab-
surdly generous to older people on high incomes. They are one of
the major reasons why households over the age of 65 (unlike house-
holds aged between 25 and 64) are paying less income tax in real
terms today than they did 20 years ago, even though their workforce
participation rates and real wages have jumped (Figure 1).9

In particular the decision by the former Coalition Government to
abolish taxes on superannuation withdrawals for those aged over 60
years in 2007 – without introducing taxes on super fund earnings
in retirement – dramatically reduced the income tax bills of older
Australians.10

      Government as part of the Simpler Super reforms. Prior to that, super income
      streams were taxed at marginal rates of personal income tax less a 15 per cent
      rebate, whereas lump sums were taxed at different rates depending on whether        Source: Daley et al. (2014, Figure 3.6)
      they exceeded reasonable benefit limits (Treasury (2008)). Superannuation
      schemes where contributions are not taxed, such as public-service defined benefit
      pensions, still have taxes applied to withdrawals.

Changes to superannuation tax arrangements in 2008 also mate-
rially increased the number of income “taxed nots”11 aged over 65.
The introduction of tax-free super benefits provided an enormous
windfall to high-income earners that had already amassed large super                     Figure 2: In stark contrast with the working population, the number of

Similarly, changes to personal income tax over the last 15 years
have disproportionately advantaged older Australians. As Figure 2
illustrates, fewer Australians aged 65 and over paid income tax in
2013-14 than did Australians of that age in 1999-00, despite the
population of Australians that age growing by over 40 per cent.

Making a transition to a fairer set of policies requires careful thought.
Younger generations, on the wrong side of the drawbridge after the
policies change, lose out when they pay for benefits for older gener-
ations that they do not receive themselves. Exempting older house-
holds from the costs of policy changes – by grandfathering existing
benefits and tax breaks, for example – simply magnifies the costs
shifted onto younger generations.

    efits that a person was allowed to receive over their lifetime was limited by rea-
    sonable benefit limits. The system was complex to administer and affected few
    taxpayers. However, it ensured that those with very large super balances paid
    additional taxes when they made large super withdrawals. Recent ASFA estimates
    suggested that 475 people with super account balances greater than $10 million
    are drawing tax-free income streams at an average of $1.5 million annually. See

2       Proposed reforms to contributions tax breaks

2.1     Targeting pre-tax contribution tax breaks where they are
        needed

People can contribute to superannuation from their pre-tax income.
                                                                                      Figure 3: Trimming pre-tax contribution tax breaks will mainly affect the

Tightening access to contributions tax breaks

The Government’s super package will reduce how much a person can
contribute to superannuation from their pre-tax income. The limit will
be reduced from $30,000 (or $35,000 for over 50s) to $25,000 a year.
Furthermore, contributions will be taxed at 30 per cent rather than
15 per cent if a person earns more than $250,000 – down from the
current threshold of $300,000.21 Treasury expects the changes will
bring in an extra $1.2 billion a year by 2019-20.22

These changes will better align superannuation tax breaks with their
policy purpose by reducing tax breaks for those who don’t need them

A better super system: assessing the 2016 tax reforms


The ALP does not support this proposal.38 It argues that those using
the new arrangements are likely to be mainly high-income earners,
and providing them with additional support should not be a priority
given budgetary constraints.                                           Figure 4: Pre-tax contributions of more than $25,000 a year will likely

lock out people with employers who have less sophisticated payroll
systems. One of the overall reform objectives should be to make
superannuation policy more stable by aligning the system with its
purpose.

2.2   Pre-tax contribution limits are sufficient for those with
      broken work histories
Some have suggested that the lower $25,000 annual cap on pre-tax
super contributions will make it harder for those with broken work
histories – particularly women and carers – to make catch-up su-
per contributions.39 Such concerns are overblown. All the evidence
shows that very few middle-income earners, and even fewer women,
make large catch-up contributions to their super funds.40
We estimate, in the absence of policy change, 2 per cent of women
will contribute more than $25,000 in 2017-18, compared to 4 per cent
of men. Of those expected to make such large contributions, almost     Notes: Assumes pre-tax contributions grow at the rate of wage growth. See documentation for

Pension (Figure 4).
Instead, most of those who contribute more than $25,000 and thus
benefit from the existing tax breaks, are men with higher incomes.

Few others have enough disposable income to make such a large
contribution to super.41 The cost of providing a tax break on contri-

2.3   “Carry forward” provisions are not needed
While most of the Government’s proposed changes will better target
contributions tax breaks, the “carry forward” provisions are a step
backwards. The Government proposes that taxpayers with a super
balance of less than $500,000 will be able to draw on unused pre-tax
caps from the previous five years to make “catch-up” contributions.
In theory, these provisions are supposed to help women, carers and
others with broken work histories. The ALP does not support this
change.42
Restricting the catch-up allowance to those with a balance of less
than $500,000 would exclude some people. But it does not materially
improve the targeting: those likely to use the catch-up allowance will
still mostly be men on higher incomes; only 11 per cent would be

Most of them would be among the top 20 per cent of income earners
(Figure 5).

be younger high-income earners, overwhelmingly men. Typically, only
high-income earners have enough disposable income to be able to

contribute more to super than the new $25,000 cap. As incomes rise
in the middle of a continuous career, high-income earners will be able
to start saving more than $25,000 a year. Provisions designed to
help women and others with broken work histories will primarily help
men with secure careers to get even further ahead.
If the carry forward provisions nevertheless remain, they should be
more tightly targeted to those with broken careers. For example, they
might be limited to those who have worked part-time in the previous
five years and restricted to those with lower super balances, such as
$300,000.43

mulated, it is merely a limit on the amount a retiree can have before
paying any tax on their super earnings. Those affected would pay
only a fraction of their total income in tax (Figure 6). For example,

Given the tax-free threshold outside of super, a single retiree can
have a combined $2.2 million in assets in and outside the superannu-
ation system before they pay a cent of tax.55 The super industry itself
believes that a $545,000 asset balance is enough to provide a home-
owning single person with a comfortable retirement, or $640,000 for a
couple.56

Nor can the Government’s proposed changes be labelled retrospec-
tive. Retrospectivity has a precise legal meaning. A retrospective
change occurs where the law is changed and, through that change
alone, some entity instantly becomes liable or guilty for a previously
legal act.57 The proposed $1.6 million cap on tax-free super earnings
in retirement does not change the tax treatment of past super earn-
ings. Rather, the change will only affect the taxes paid on future super
earnings.

Lots of legislative changes affect investments made in the past, and

ASFA.

Second, ASFA’s estimate confuses the number of TTR accounts with
the much lower number of people affected. Australians on average
have two superannuation accounts.67 Further, as is well known in
the super industry, many people using TTR pensions have many
more than two accounts in order to maximize the tax advantages.68
Therefore the estimated 230,000 super accounts affected belong to
far fewer than 230,000 people.

Critics have argued the $500,000 lifetime cap is both retrospective
and too low.75 Both these claims are incorrect.

ultimately depend on a person’s circumstances in the future, and
attach liabilities to these circumstances.
The cap on post-tax contributions only applies to additional post-tax
contributions in the future. The Budget explicitly states that contribu-
tions made before the announcement are not affected, even where
they exceed $500,000.76 True, the limits take into account the amount
that has already been contributed, but no adverse consequence flows
from historic contributions; the change merely limits future contribu-
tions. To draw an analogy, legislation is not retrospective if it changes

assess future Age Pension payments.

A $500,000 lifetime cap is not too low

A $500,000 lifetime cap will not lead to a mass movement onto
the Age Pension. Some might think that a $500,000 super balance
doesn’t sound like much. But it is larger than the super balance of

A better super system: assessing the 2016 tax reforms


Consider the example of a retired 70-year old earning $150,000 a
year just from an investment portfolio. They do not work and therefore
cannot contribute to superannuation under current arrangements.
If the proposed change takes effect, they will be able to contribute
$25,000 (the new pre-tax contribution cap) into superannuation. On
this contribution – which is really just investment income – they would
pay contribution tax of 15 per cent instead of their marginal rate of
39 per cent. This would reduce their total tax bill by $6000. Future
earnings on the $25,000 contributed would be tax-free.
In addition, those not working would be able to transfer other savings
as post-tax contributions into superannuation, where future earnings
are either untaxed, or only taxed at 15 per cent. This will be a particu-
larly attractive tax-planning opportunity if the lifetime cap on post-tax
contributions is not legislated.

             reforms to TTR pensions is consistent with that of the Productivity Commission. Our estimate of the number of
             people affected by more than one policy change is likely to be an underestimate, and hence the total number
             affected by any one measure in the super package will be overestimated, due to data limitations.

6      Contribution to budget repair

The Government’s super package will make a significant contribution
to budget repair, which will grow over time as super matures and the
population ages. Measures that reduce the earnings tax breaks to
high-income earners – especially the $1.6 million cap on tax-free           Figure 8: The Government’s super package will save less than
super earnings in retirement and the $500,000 lifetime cap on post-         $1 billion a year once fully implemented
tax contributions – will reduce the budgetary cost of super tax breaks      Net budget impact of super package components over the forward estimates
in the long-term, which have become unsustainable. Importantly,
these changes will have little or no impact on future Age Pension
expenditures, since they overwhelmingly affect high-income earners
who are unlikely to ever qualify for the Age Pension in retirement.91

Yet despite including measures which reduce superannuation tax
breaks by $2.6 billion a year by 2019-20, the annual budget savings
from the Government’s super proposals will only total $0.775 billion
once fully implemented, as Figure 8 illustrates. This is because widely
publicised cuts to super tax breaks for high-income earners are offset
by measures that widen access to super tax breaks to other groups.
Retaining the LISTO is expected to cost the Budget $800 million a
year by 2019-20. Permitting all taxpayers to contribute directly to their
super fund and claim a deduction on their personal income tax return
will cost a further $750 million.

Other measures to expand contributions tax breaks – measures that
should not proceed because they do little to support the purposes of
super – reduce the budgetary savings from the Government’s super
package by a further $305 million a year (Table 1 on page 4).               Notes: Fiscal savings are as reported in the 2016-17 Budget. Extending the income threshold

2019-20, and more over time.92 If these changes do not proceed, the
budgetary savings from the government’s package would be boosted
to about $1 billion a year in total.
The ALP is proposing reforms that would do more to repair the budget
than the Government’s plan. The ALP’s super package would raise
$2.1 billion a year, or $1.3 billion a year more than Government’s
proposal (Table 1). If the Government makes “concessions”, they will
mostly improve the budget position. In contrast, many amendments
to the government’s package advocated by industry groups, such as
watering down the limits on super tax breaks for high-income earners
that don’t need them, could easily result in a package that makes the
budget position worse overall.




92. The government estimates the measure will only cost $350 million over the four
    years to 2019-20. However, since taxpayers will only be able to carry forward the
    unused portion of their contributions cap from 1 July 2017 onwards, the full cost
    of the policy change will only become apparent from 2021-22 onwards, when
    individuals have access to unused caps over the previous four years. Daley and

Treasury projections in the 2016 Budget show that the lifetime value                     Pension and super tax breaks in 2016
of tax breaks to high-income men remains much higher than the
value of the Age Pension for low-income earners, even after the
Government’s Budget changes (Figure 9). These projections are
likely to be conservative since they ignore all post-tax super contribu-
tions, which are largely made by high-income earners, boosting the
super earnings tax breaks they receive.93

Before the changes, someone in the top 1 per cent of income earners
could expect to receive two-and-a-half times as much in tax breaks
from super over their lifetime as a retiree with no assets receives in
pension. This is also two-and-a-half times as much as the average
income earner receives in pension and super tax breaks combined.

93. Different assumptions about life expectancy and draw down rates can also result
    in much higher estimates of the lifetime benefits to high-income earners. For
    example, Industry Super Australia (2015) calculates that superannuation tax
    breaks for the top 5 per cent of income earners are worth more than $2 million for
    men over their lifetimes.                                                            Source: Treasury (2016a, p. 4)

Many other features of Australia’s retirement incomes system also
need reform, and could contribute to the task of budget repair. Areas
beyond the scope of this paper include:

   ∙ Increasing the age at which tax-free withdrawals can be made
      from super to match the age of access to the pension;96
   ∙ Better targeting the Age Pension by including owner-occupied
      housing in the Age Pension assets test;97
   ∙ Reducing the value of superannuation tax breaks for small
      business owners, such as the lifetime CGT cap;
   ∙ Restricting the Seniors and Pensioners Tax Offset (SAPTO),
     which provides a much higher tax-free threshold for pensioners
     and other retirees.98
   ∙ Better targeting government support for aged-care costs by
      tightening the means tests for home-based and residential aged
      care, and especially by including more of the value of the family
      home.
